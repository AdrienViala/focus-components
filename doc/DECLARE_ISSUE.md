## How can I describe my issue the best ?

To clarify / standardize the declaration a maximum of your issues, we invite you very strongly to follow the pattern below:

__Title :__ `[Component] very short resume of the issue`

> it is important that everyone can understand and know the affected component your issue by reading this sentence

__Body / description :__
```markdown
# Actual behaviour

[Description of the actual behaviour and what is the problem / issue for you]

[Screen shots : if possible, use animated gifs for a better illustration]

# Expected behaviour

[Description of the exprected behaviour]

[if you judge it necessary, add a wireframe]

# Versions

Focus-core: [version]
Focus-components: [version]

```
